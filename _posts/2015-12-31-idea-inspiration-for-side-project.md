### Create A Web Or Mobile App

What sort of apps should you make? Make an app that excites you.
But if you're really stumped for ideas, here are a few in no particular order: 

- Personal to-do list
- Content link aggregator
- URL shortener
- Media hoster
- Media optimizer
- Social network

### Create A Brower Extension

For idea inspiration, browser through the lists for [Best Firefox Addons](http://www.makeuseof.com/pages/best-firefox-addons) and [Best Chrome Extensions](http://www.makeuseof.com/pages/best-chrome-extensions). Some are brower-specific, such as these [awesome Firefox-only extensions](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-extensions-firefox-users-love-browser/), and are ripe for someone to come along and create a clone on other browsers.

### Create A Video Game

The [game development tools](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/five-free-game-development-tools-make-your-own-games/) have all envolved so much over the years that any newbie could have a simple but playable game ready within weeks. Recommend that beginners start by [learning the Unity Engine](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/programming-game-unity-beginners-guide/). You can try cloing these popular classics: Pong, Breakout, Tetris, Bomberman, Flappy Bird.

### Contribute To Open Source
